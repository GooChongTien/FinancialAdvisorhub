## Why These Are Archived

Files in this folder are:
1. **Superseded** by newer versions
2. **Reference material** from external sources no longer needed
3. **Historical artifacts** kept for audit/history purposes
4. **One-time fixes** that were manually applied

## Maintenance

Feel free to delete files from this archive after:
- Confirming they're not referenced elsewhere
- Ensuring git history has them if needed
- Documenting any important context elsewhere
