## Domain 1 – Product Knowledge & Application

**Core question:**  
> “Given this client’s situation, which products, in what order, and why?”

### Domain 1 Scenario Table

| # | Scenario Name | Summary | Key Knowledge Atoms (examples) |
|---|---------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Young Family with Heavy Commitments | Married couple in late 20s, one child, HDB/BTO or new mortgage, supporting parents, several confusing ILPs. They think they are “well covered” but actually lack CI/disability and rely on group cover. | Protection-first ordering; life cover sizing; CI sizing; term vs whole decision. |
| 2 | Young Single “Just Wants to Invest” | 25-year-old single, no dependants, good income, minimal insurance. Asks for “something with better returns than fixed deposits” and is curious about ILPs. | Protection-first ordering; basic medical + CI first; term vs ILP; suitability vs “chasing returns”. |
| 3 | “Whole Life vs Term – Which Is Better?” | Client has read blogs saying whole life is bad, but agent is strongly promoting whole life with multipliers as “best of both worlds”. Client is genuinely confused. | Term vs whole life decision tree; separating protection needs from investment goals; explaining guarantees vs bonuses in simple language. |
| 4 | Muslim Client Choosing Takaful vs Conventional (MY) | 32-year-old Muslim professional in Malaysia wants to insure family and is unsure whether to use takaful or conventional insurance; hears friends say “just buy the cheapest”. | Takaful vs conventional choice; values-based framing; explaining cooperative risk sharing and Shariah aspects. |
| 5 | Older Client with Limited Income | 60+ client with low income, no private medical cover, only basic national scheme. Wants to “not burden children” if hospitalised. | Hospitalisation priority; affordability and plan sizing; deciding what not to cover; safeguards for vulnerable clients. |

---

### Example Scenario – Young Single “Just Wants to Invest”

**Client Snapshot**

- Age: 25, single, working in a stable job.
- Income: SGD 4,000/month.
- No dependants, no mortgage yet.
- Has only basic national health scheme, no integrated shield, no CI or disability cover.
- Asks: “I want something with higher returns than fixed deposits. My friend bought an ILP, should I?”

**Expert Mental Model**

1. **Reframe the conversation: protection first, then investment.**  
   - Check hospitalisation and income protection before any ILP/endowment.
   - Explain that medical and CI protect *future earning power*.

2. **Quantify minimum viable protection:**
   - Medical: integrated hospital plan.
   - CI: maybe 1–2 years of income.
   - Disability income (if available and affordable).

3. **Only then consider investment products:**
   - Separate pure investments (funds, ETFs, etc.) from insurance.
   - Explain ILP complexity and fees vs simpler investment routes.

4. **Decision outcome example:**
   - Step 1: Install medical + basic CI.
   - Step 2: Allocate remaining savings capacity to investment portfolio, not necessarily through insurance.

**Knowledge Atoms involved:**

- KA-PROD-01 – Protection-First Ordering  
- KA-PROD-02 – Life Cover Sizing (if future dependants/mortgage discussed)

## Domain 2 – Advisory Process & Financial Needs Analysis (FNA)

**Core question:**  
> “How do I structure fact-finding and needs analysis into a coherent, documented recommendation?”

### Domain 2 Scenario Table

| # | Scenario Name | Summary | Key Knowledge Atoms |
|---|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | First-Time Full FNA | Advisor meets a new client (mid-30s, married, 1 child) for a comprehensive financial review. Client has policies from several insurers and is confused. | Comprehensive fact-find checklist; needs-based analysis; protection vs savings vs retirement; documenting “no new product” if appropriate. |
| 2 | Client Wants “Safe, Better Than Fixed Deposit” | Near-retiree with lump sum (e.g. SGD 100k) says they want something “safe like fixed deposit but higher interest”. Bank or agent is tempted to suggest complex products. | Needs analysis for capital preservation; mapping objectives to product types; suitability vs complexity; explaining trade-offs simply. |
| 3 | Policy Replacement Proposal | Client has a long-standing traditional policy; competitor proposes switching to a new ILP with “better returns”. | Policy replacement checklist; comparing charges, guarantees, surrender penalties; documenting rationale for replacing or not replacing. |
| 4 | Life Event Review – New Child & Mortgage | Existing client had term + basic CI while single; now has spouse, baby, new housing loan. | Life-event triggered review FNA; recalculating cover; recognising increased responsibilities; planning an update roadmap. |
| 5 | “No Product Is Best” Case | Client is heavily insured but financially stretched; best advice may be to reduce coverage or not add more. | Needs vs affordability; ethical decision to say “no new product”; documentation of rationale. |

---

### Example Scenario – Life Event Review: New Child & Mortgage

**Client Snapshot**

- Age: 33, married, 1-year-old child.
- New mortgage: SGD 500k.
- Existing cover:  
  - Term life SGD 200k  
  - No CI, no disability income  
  - Integrated hospital plan  
- Objective: “I want to make sure my family is okay if anything happens.”

**Expert Mental Model**

1. **Trigger: life event = automatic review.**
   - Marriage, child, mortgage = major changes.
   - Update dependants, liabilities, and income.

2. **Recalculate needs:**
   - Life cover often needs to increase (mortgage + several years of income).
   - CI and disability income needs become much more important.

3. **Gap analysis:**
   - Current term SGD 200k < likely needed amount.
   - Zero CI/disability coverage is a serious gap.

4. **Plan options:**
   - Increase term to cover mortgage + income replacement.
   - Add CI and/or disability income within budget.
   - Schedule future review for education/retirement planning.

Family suspects mis-selling. | Vulnerable client safeguards; ILP suitability; mis-selling red flags; complaint and remediation flow. |
| 2 | Using a Customer Knowledge Assessment (CKA) Result | Client “passes” a knowledge assessment, but clearly does not understand investment risks. Advisor is tempted to sell a high-risk ILP or complex wrap. | ILP suitability vs CKA; obligation to ensure understanding; documenting advice. |
| 3 | High Premium vs Income | Agent proposes a premium that is 20–30% of client’s income for savings/investment policies. | Mis-selling red-flag pattern; budget-driven suitability; prioritising essentials. |
| 4 | Policy Replacement Without Full Comparison | Agent proposes replacing an old policy purely for higher projected returns, without clearly listing disadvantages. | Replacement decision checklist; disclosure and comparison duties. |
| 5 | Complaint Handling & Escalation | Client feels misled and wants to cancel or complain. Agent is unsure how to respond without being defensive. | Complaint and remediation flow; documentation; empathy and fairness. |

---

### Example Scenario – High Premium vs Income

**Client Snapshot**

- Income: MYR 3,000/month.
- Agent proposes ILP with premium MYR 800/month as “forced savings and investment”.
- Client is hesitant but likes the “discipline” idea.

**Expert Mental Model**

1. **Red-flag: premium is over 25% of income.**
   - This is a large obligation for basic living standards.
   - If circumstances change, risk of lapse is high.

2. **Re-evaluate needs and priorities:**
   - Confirm existing cover (medical, life, CI).
   - Confirm debts, dependants, emergency savings.

3. **Offer scaled alternatives:**
   - Lower premium level (e.g. MYR 200–300) with more flexible protection.
   - Emphasise building emergency savings and basic protection first.

4. **Document clearly:**
   - Record discussion about affordability and alternatives.
   - If client chooses high premium despite advice, note that as well.

## 3.1 Pre-Meeting Copilot Output (Sample)

The copilot receives client and meeting data and produces:

### A. Suggested Meeting Agenda (Advisor-Facing)

1. **Build understanding and comfort**
   - Confirm preferred language.
   - Ask what she worries about most regarding health and money.

2. **Clarify current medical protection**
   - Check what she knows about her basic national health cover.
   - Explain possible gaps (e.g., extra hospital charges, choice of hospital/ward).

3. **Discuss budget honestly**
   - Establish a comfortable monthly premium range.
   - Stress that the plan must be sustainable even in a bad month.

4. **Explore a simple protection option**
   - Focus on one clear, basic hospital plan.
   - Avoid complex add-ons unless she shows strong capacity and understanding.

5. **Agree on a next step**
   - If she is not ready to decide, clarify what exactly she wants to think about.
   - Offer a simple summary sheet in her preferred language.

### B. Prep Cards (By Atom)

#### [KA-PROD-01] Protection-First Ordering

- **Why this matters for this client**
  - Hospital bills are the main threat; investment or savings products are not appropriate at this stage.
  - She has no private hospital cover but is in a high-risk age group.
  - A clear medical solution addresses exactly what she worries about.

- **Questions to ask**
  - “If you needed to stay in hospital for a few days, how do you imagine paying the bill right now?”
  - “What kind of hospital or ward would you feel comfortable in?”
  - “What is more important to you: lower cost with fewer choices, or more choice even if the premium is slightly higher?”

- **Pitfalls to avoid**
  - Introducing savings or complex investment products.
  - Overloading her with many different plan variants at once.

---

#### [KA-FNA-02] Needs Prioritisation Under Budget Constraint

- **Why this matters**
  - Her income is low; a premium that is too high may cause stress and lapses.
  - It is better to have a smaller, sustainable plan than to start something she cannot keep.
  - You must co-create a budget that she truly feels comfortable with.

- **Questions to ask**
  - “After paying your monthly expenses, how much do you feel you can safely set aside for insurance?”
  - “If your income drops for a few months, what amount of premium would still feel manageable?”
  - “Would you like your daughter to help with the premium, and if so, what amount is realistic for her?”

- **Pitfalls to avoid**
  - Designing a plan at the highest amount she can possibly pay.
  - Not writing down an agreed budget range.

---

#### [KA-ETH-01] Vulnerable Client Safeguards

- **Why this matters**
  - Age, low income, and limited English increase her vulnerability.
  - Regulators expect more care with such clients.
  - The goal is not just a signed form, but clear understanding and free consent.

- **Steps to take**
  - Confirm language and speak slowly with simple words.
  - Involve the daughter as support, but always check that the mother understands and agrees.
  - Ask the client to explain the plan back in her own words (teach-back).

- **Pitfalls to avoid**
  - Only talking to the daughter.
  - Using technical terms without explanation.
  - Rushing to get signatures.

---

#### [KA-PSY-03] Handling “I Need to Think About It”

- **Why this matters**
  - Older clients often say they want to think because they are unsure or afraid of committing.
  - Understanding her specific worry will guide your follow-up and plan design.
  - Pressure will damage trust, especially when the daughter is present.

- **Questions to ask**
  - “When you say you want to think about it, what is the main thing you want to think about? The price, the coverage, or something else?”
  - “Would it help if I give you a simple one-page summary to take home and read with your daughter?”

- **Pitfalls to avoid**
  - Accepting “I’ll think about it” without clarification.
  - Pushing for decision on the same day when she looks uncomfortable.

## 3.2 In-Meeting Micro-Coaching (“Whispers”)

Imagine the copilot is listening to a transcript and surfaces **tiny cards** during key moments.

### Moment 1 – Early Fact-Find

**Transcript snippet**

- Client: “I can still work now, my health is okay. I just worry that when I am older and if I need to be in hospital, my daughter will have to pay everything. I don’t want that.”  
- Advisor: “So your main worry is becoming a financial burden if you get sick, is that right?”

**Copilot whisper**

- **[KA-PROD-01] Protection-First Ordering**  
  - **Next move:** Stay with the hospitalisation risk. Ask what she believes her current cover does, and gently highlight the gap.  
  - **Suggested question:** “What do you think your current government health cover pays for, and what do you think you still have to pay yourself?”

- **[KA-ETH-01] Vulnerable Client Safeguards**  
  - **Next move:** Confirm language comfort.  
  - **Suggested question:** “Would you prefer that I explain everything in simple English, or should I slow down and let your daughter help to translate?”

---

### Moment 2 – Budget Concern

**Transcript snippet**

- Advisor (after explaining a plan): “This plan would cost about 150 dollars per month.”  
- Client: “150 is quite a lot. I only earn about 1,200 a month. I have to think about it.”  
- Daughter: “Maybe it’s a bit high for her, but hospital can be very expensive.”

**Copilot whisper**

- **[KA-FNA-02] Needs Prioritisation Under Budget Constraint**  
  - **Next move:** Step back from that specific plan. Co-create a comfortable budget range with them before adjusting cover.  
  - **Suggested question:** “What is an amount per month that you feel you can safely handle without stress? For example, is something around 80 dollars more comfortable?”

- **[KA-PSY-03] Handling “I Need to Think About It”**  
  - **Next move:** Treat “I have to think” as a signal of affordability fear. Name it gently.  
  - **Suggested question:** “Is your main worry that the premium may be too heavy every month, or is there another part you are unsure about?”

---

### Moment 3 – At End of Meeting

**Transcript snippet**

- Advisor (after adjusting plan to ~90/month): “With this simpler plan, the premium is around 90 dollars a month. It mainly protects you from large hospital bills.”  
- Client: “That sounds better, but I still want to discuss with my daughter at home and think about it.”  
- Daughter: “Mum, I think it could help, but yes, we can discuss.”

**Copilot whisper**

- **[KA-PSY-03] Handling “I Need to Think About It”**  
  - **Next move:** Clarify what she wants to think about and secure a clear follow-up.  
  - **Suggested question:** “Of course, you should take time. To help you think clearly, what is the main part you want to discuss at home: the price, the hospital choices, or something else?”

- **[KA-ETH-01] Vulnerable Client Safeguards**  
  - **Next move:** Offer written summary as a memory aid.  
  - **Suggested phrase:** “I will prepare a one-page summary in simple language for you and your daughter. You can read it at home and write down any questions. Then next week we can talk again before you decide.”

---

## 3.3 Post-Meeting Debrief & Coaching

After the meeting, the advisor writes short notes:

> “Explained current national health cover vs private plan. Showed two options, 150/month and 90/month. She felt 150 was too high. She still wants to think about the 90 one. I explained in simple language, involved the daughter, and offered to send a summary. Follow-up call planned next week.”

The copilot then evaluates which atoms were used and where improvement is possible.

### A. Atoms Applied

- **KA-PROD-01 – Protection-First Ordering**  
  - Evidence: Focused on hospitalisation risk only; did not introduce savings or investment products.

- **KA-FNA-02 – Needs Prioritisation Under Budget Constraint**  
  - Evidence: Adjusted from 150/month to 90/month after budget concern.

- **KA-ETH-01 – Vulnerable Client Safeguards**  
  - Evidence: Used simple explanations, involved daughter, offered summary.

### B. Potentially Missing or Underused Atoms

- **KA-FNA-01 – Comprehensive Fact-Find Checklist**  
  - **Why it matters:**  
    - Notes do not show a structured record of her monthly expenses, savings goals, or other obligations.  
    - That information would strengthen the suitability record.
  - **Follow-up action:**  
    - During the next call, ask 3–4 short questions about expenses, savings, and other support she receives. Update her FNA file.

- **KA-PSY-03 – Handling “I Need to Think About It”** (partial)  
  - **Why it matters:**  
    - You respected her decision to think, which is good.  
    - However, it is not clear you identified her *main* worry (price vs benefits vs trust).  
  - **Follow-up action:**  
    - In the next call, ask: “What did you think about most after our meeting: the cost, the coverage, or something else?”  
    - Address that specific concern before asking her to decide.

### C. Short Coaching Summary to Advisor

> You did well to focus on hospital protection and adjust the premium to her budget.  
> You also handled her as a vulnerable client, which is important.  
> For your next step, improve your fact-find notes and be more specific about her concern when she says she wants to think. This will make your follow-up clearer and more helpful.
