| **Profile Setting Page**                            | The Profile Setting page currently has no “Back” button, making it difficult for users to return to the previous page.                             | Add a “Back” button on the Profile Setting page. When clicked, it should route the user back to the homepage.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Home Page – Quick Links**                         | The +New Lead and +QuickQuote widget buttons are oversized and include unnecessary descriptions (“add a new prospect”, “generate instant quotes”). | Reduce the widget size of +New Lead and +QuickQuote buttons. Remove the descriptions under each button.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Home Page – Hot Leads**                           | The Hot Leads section displays up to 4 leads, with large lead cards showing excess details.                                                        | Limit the Hot Leads display to a maximum of 3 leads. Each lead card should only show **Name**, **Last Contacted**, and **Proposal Stage**.

| **Home Page – Hot Leads → View All**                | When clicking **View All** in the Hot Leads widget, the system navigates to the Customer Management page with no filters applied.                  | Clicking **View All** should open the Customer Management page prefiltered with **relationship = lead** and **temperature = warm**.                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Customer – Search & Filter**                      | The Customer Management filter panel includes “Created From” and “Created To” filters, which are not required.                                     | Remove the “Created From” and “Created To” filters from the Customer Management page.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Customer – Leads Count Label Position**           | The “Showing 4 of 9 leads” label appears above the “Active filters applied” section.                                                               | Relocate the label to the **bottom-right corner** of the Search & Filter box.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Customer – Search & Filter Layout**               | The current search and filter area occupies too much vertical space, making the layout look cluttered.                                             | Redesign the Search & Filter box to be compact. Display a **search bar**, **filter icon**, and **sort icon** only.

| **Customer – Invalid Labels**                       | Some leads are shown with invalid status labels such as “Qualified” or “Negotiation.”                                                              | Remove invalid or unsupported labels from the customer list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Customer Detail Page – Lead Status**              | The Lead Status field is currently a manual dropdown, allowing users to select values directly.                                                    | Lead Status should be **system-determined** based on data rules:<br>• **Not Initiated:** New lead with no past appointments or proposals.<br>• **Contacted:** Past appointments exist, but no active proposal.<br>• **Proposal:** Active proposal found.                                    |
| **Customer Detail Page – Personal Details Section** | The “Personal Details” section displays the wording “view only,” making the UI redundant.                                                          | Remove the “view only” text label, but keep the **Personal Details** section as non-editable.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Customer Detail Page – Appointments Section**     | The Appointments section shows “+New” and “View All” buttons, which are redundant within this view.                                                | Remove the “+New” and “View All” buttons from the Appointments section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Customer Detail Page / Portfolio**                | When accessing an existing customer (e.g., via link), the page displays blank or fails to load.                                                    | Ensure that the system correctly loads the Customer Details page when an existing customer is accessed.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Customer Detail Page / Portfolio – Quick Links**  | The Quick Link section shows inconsistent actions (only “new proposal”, “resume proposal”, “schedule appointment”).                                | Always display **New Proposal** and **Schedule Appointment**. If an ongoing proposal exists, also show **Resume Proposal**. Clicking **Resume Proposal** should redirect to **New Business** page, pre-filtered by that client.                                                             |
| **New Business – Page Layout**                      | The New Business page currently allows only basic search and filter without UI consistency.                                                        | Redesign New Business page to match Customer Management style: a **search bar**, **filter icon**, and **sort icon**. Allow filters for **stages** and **status**, and sorting by **date updated** or **stage** (ascending = Fact Finding → FNA → Recommendation → Quotation → Application). |
| **New Business – Stage Label**                      | The process stage is currently labeled “FNA.”                                                                                                      | Rename “FNA” stage to **Financial Planning** for clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Proposal Details – Header Behavior**              | The header and stage progress bar are not fixed at the top, and a transparent bar is visible.                                                      | Freeze the **header and stage progress bar** at the top of the screen. Remove the transparent top bar.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Proposal Details – Section Scroll**               | Clicking a section in the proposal auto-scrolls, but the section header appears hidden beneath the top bar.                                        | Adjust scroll behavior so that the section header is fully visible beneath the fixed header and stage bar.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Proposal Details – Fact Finding Sequence**        | The Fact Finding subsections are shown in the wrong order.                                                                                         | Correct the order to: **Personal Details → Dependents → CKA → RPQ**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Proposal Details – Fact Finding Structure**       | The four subsections (Personal Details, Dependents, CKA, RPQ) appear as separate, unrelated sections.                                              | Group the four subsections under a single **Fact Finding** container to visually cluster them.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
