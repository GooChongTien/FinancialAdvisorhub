### 🧱 Why This Format Works
- Each **row = 1 atomic navigable unit** (screen, section, or field)
- Claude or your orchestrator can parse column headers and build:
  - route trees,
  - API bindings,
  - and validation logic directly
- You can extend this easily for `/customers/detail` or `/new-business` without schema drift
